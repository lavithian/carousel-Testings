On the shoulders are massive spaulders made of many layers of metal that fall almost to the wearer's wrists. Falling to the wearer's knees is a skirt-like garment, also made from layers of metal. Both the spaulders and the skirt change color to match that of the wearer's ink. Forearm guards, which also match the wearer's Ink color, are strapped on with a single green band each, and around the waist is a slightly thinner white band. A small black object, possibly a sheathed weapon, is tucked into this band at an angle."
