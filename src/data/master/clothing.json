    "description": "The Zink Layered LS consists of a long-sleeved, dark gray T-shirt and the short-sleeved white T-shirt worn over it. The white shirt has a large Zink logo on the front in black, white, and magenta, and a tiny, olive green tag at the bottom. A small version of the logo is printed on the shirt's back. Also at the bottom, the hem of the dark gray shirt can be seen poking out."
